# NBA Shot Probability Analysis                     ![download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34041602/61908592-43d49c00-aeed-11e9-81f4-4c51c50d5696.png)


**Research Questions**

NBA teams are constantly searching for better players and court strategy. There are many aspects of an NBA player that a general manager must consider when performing their analysis: offensive and defensive ability, makeup, personality, etc. Many of these skills, especially those pertaining to offense and defense, can be quantified using statistical measures. One of the most common measures in basketball pertains to shot results. 

Our project aims to improve the court performance from both offensive side and defensive side with following research questions: 

• How do offenders affect shot results? 
• How do defenders affect shot results? 

**Data Source**

We obtained original shot log dataset from Kaggle contains 128069 shot observations that occurred during NBA 2014-2015 season. 
Source: Kaggle    https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs 
The uploader scraped this dataset from NBA's REST API 

**Methodology**

Exploratotry Data Analysis: Data Processing, Variables Exploration,  
Data Modeling: Logistic Regression) 
Model Evaluation: ROC curve and Confusion Matrix

**Recommmendation**

Offensive Side: 

• Don’t be afraid of “Away Games”

• Having more “Catch and Shoot”  

• “Early Fighters” win the game 

Defensive Side:

• Keep closer 

• The taller, the better
